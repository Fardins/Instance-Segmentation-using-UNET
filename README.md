UNET Instance Segmentation Application
This project implements an instance segmentation application using a UNET model. The application allows users to load and visualize images and their predicted segmentation masks. It is built with PyTorch, Albumentations, and Streamlit.

Features
Instance Segmentation: Uses a UNET model to predict segmentation masks for input images.
Interactive User Interface: Built using Streamlit for ease of use.
Custom Dataset Support: Easily adapts to datasets structured with separate directories for images and masks.
Visualization: Displays original images and predicted segmentation masks side by side.
